# conference-room-reservation-system

This application is my final project for SDA Academy, I did it on my own and I learned a lot of things.
The application is written in Java Spring Boot, MySQL, Angular, and Bootstrap

Boy, was angular not beginner friendly, I made plenty of mistakes along the way and had to use a few resources: 

I used the angular-calendar component found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-calendar

I used various ng-bootstrap components found here: https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home
